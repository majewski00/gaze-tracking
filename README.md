# GazeTracking
## Overview
GazeTracking is a deep neural network project designed to predict the point of gaze on a computer screen by analyzing facial images. Notably, the achieved results are obtained using a relatively modest RGB camera (0.9 MP laptop webcam) without additional variations in illumination, such as an infrared light projector. This technology holds numerous practical applications, with one notable example being its potential to assist individuals with various Motor Neuron Diseases in using electronic devices.
